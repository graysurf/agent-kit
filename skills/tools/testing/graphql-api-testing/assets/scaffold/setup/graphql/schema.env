# GraphQL schema (SDL) location for the GraphQL API testing skill.
#
# Used by:
# - $CODEX_COMMANDS_PATH/api-gql schema
#
# Notes:
# - This file is safe to commit (no secrets).
# - For per-developer overrides, create:
#     setup/graphql/schema.local.env
#   (and keep it uncommitted / gitignored via setup/graphql/*.local.env).
# - Relative paths are resolved under setup/graphql/.

# Canonical, committed schema file path.
#
# Recommended: keep it under setup/graphql/ (so relative paths stay simple):
GQL_SCHEMA_FILE=schema.gql
#
# If your repo keeps the schema at repo root (e.g. ./schema.gql), use:
# GQL_SCHEMA_FILE=../../schema.gql
