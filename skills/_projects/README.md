# Project-specific skills

This folder hosts project-specific skill packs. New entries are ignored by
default (see `skills/_projects/.gitignore`), so local/private skills can live
here without being tracked. If a project pack should be versioned, add it
explicitly under `skills/_projects/<project>/` and remove it from ignore as
needed.

Keep cross-project or generally reusable skills under the main `skills/`
categories instead.
